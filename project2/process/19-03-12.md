### Input
#### Tokenizing
* Input string can be a word, or multiple words.
* In case of words the command must be divided into each string.
* Used string.h library's strtok function to divide them.

#### Exception: more will be added
* Case #1: "\n" input -> ERROR: Input command
* Case #2: multiple words -> fgets + tokenizing
* Case #3: only a word -> used if/else <br>
  (this case happened because, at first I only made case for commands with indents)
